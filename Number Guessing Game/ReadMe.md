# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game** â€” a fun and beginner-friendly console game built in Python!  
Try to guess the number I'm thinking of (between 1 and 100) in 7 attempts or less.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The program randomly picks a number from 1 to 100.
- You get **7 tries** to guess it correctly.
- After each guess, you'll get feedback:
  - "Too low" if your guess is less than the secret number.
  - "Too high" if your guess is greater.
  - "Correct!" if you guessed it right ðŸŽ‰
- After each round, you're asked if you want to play again.
- All game results are **logged to a file** called `game_score.txt`.
